The hospital management needed a comprehensive dashboard to track key healthcare metrics, identify trends, and improve decision-making.


## Project Overview  
In this project, I took on the role of a **Data Analyst at a Multi-Specialty Hospital**, tasked with building an **interactive dashboard** to analyze patient and appointment data. The goal was to **enhance hospital efficiency and patient care** by transforming raw data into actionable insights using **Power BIâ€™s advanced functionalities**.  

## Objective  
The hospital management needed a **comprehensive dashboard** to track key healthcare metrics, identify trends, and improve decision-making. My responsibilities included:  
- Cleaning and transforming raw data to ensure accuracy.  
- Creating **DAX measures** to track appointment trends.  
- Designing **interactive visualizations** for deep analysis.  

## Approach  

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
Using **Power Query**, I cleaned the raw data by:  
âœ” Removing duplicates  
âœ” Replacing null values  
âœ” Standardizing data formats  

### 2. **Analysis with DAX Measures**  
I created key **DAX measures** to gain insights into hospital operations, including:  
ðŸ“ˆ **Appointment Growth** â€“ Tracking trends in patient visits  
âœ… **Completed Appointments** â€“ Monitoring attended sessions  
ðŸ“Š **Monthly Appointments** â€“ Understanding seasonal patterns  
ðŸ“Œ **Total Appointments** â€“ Measuring overall patient flow  
ðŸ‘¥ **Total Patients** â€“ Analyzing hospital reach  

### 3. **Data Visualization & Dashboard Design**  
I used **Power BIâ€™s advanced visualization tools** to create an interactive dashboard with:  
ðŸ“… **Date Timelines** â€“ For tracking trends over time  
ðŸ“Š **Multiple Visuals** â€“ Bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs for different perspectives  
ðŸ”Ž **Deep Analysis Filters** â€“ Allowing hospital management to explore data dynamically  

## Key Learnings  
Through this project, I strengthened my expertise in:  
âœ… **Advanced Data Cleaning** â€“ Ensuring high-quality data for analysis  
âœ… **DAX for Insights** â€“ Creating powerful metrics for decision-making  
âœ… **Storytelling with Data** â€“ Presenting findings in an impactful way  
âœ… **Interactive Dashboards** â€“ Enhancing user engagement and analysis  

## Conclusion  
This project showcases my **ability to transform raw healthcare data into meaningful insights** using Power BI. It highlights my **technical expertise in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling**â€”key skills for **data-driven decision-making** in the healthcare sector.
